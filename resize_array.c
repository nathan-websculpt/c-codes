	// You can't resize statically allocated arrays

	// A statically allocated array (i.e. static array) like this cannot be 
	// resized, it will always have the length of 1000.  If we have a program 
	// that needs some varying number of int values as determined at runtime, 
	// one thing we could do is declare the array to have the maximum possible 
	// length required for this problem.  We could refer to this as the "capacity"
	// of the array, while maintaining a separate concept of the "length" or 
	// "size" of the array (i.e. how much of the array are we actually using).
	//
	// We could then have logic which ensures that we do not exceed the array 
	// capacity, while other logic could depend on the length of the array 
	// to do things like access the elements in the portion of the array 
	// that we are actually using.  So while the array's max capacity could be 
	// 1000, maybe at runtime we determine that we only need 200 elements, and 
	// so we have loops that depend on this length of 200.  This length could 
	// change as the program executes and we need to use more or less int values.
	//
	// This would be one workaround solution to the fact that we cannot resize 
	// a statically allocated array.  It would mean that we have unused memory, 
	// but maybe we are OK with this.  Note that a statically allocated array 
	// is stored in a place in memory called the stack.
	//
	// int array[1000];
	// int capacity = 1000;  <--- keeps track of the capacity of the array
	// int length = ...;     <--- tracks the length used, determined at runtime
	//
	// if (exceed capacity)  <--- code to ensure we do not exceed array capacity
	// {
	//   error message
	// }
	//
	// for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)  <-- logic to work with the portion of the
	// {                                     array which is practically used, e.g.
	//   ... array[i] ...                    accessing all the elements in this 
	// }                                     portion and doing some work with them
	//


	// We CAN resize a dynamically allocated array, which is stored in a different
	// place in memory called the heap.  We have to use a function like malloc() 
	// or calloc() to allocate a block of space in memory.  Here we call malloc() 
	// and pass it 3 x the size in bytes that it takes to store an int [as provided 
	// by size()], so that it allocates a block of memory with enough bytes to 
	// store 3 int values.  We keep track of the size of the array using length.
	// The call to malloc() returns a pointer, i.e. a memory address for this 
	// block of memory, which we store into data.
	//
	int length = 3;
	int *data = malloc(length * sizeof(int));

	// We can use array notation with data to set the elements of the array.
	data[0] = 4;
	data[1] = 5;
	data[2] = 6;

	// If later on the program determines it needs a larger array, we can increase
	// length which tracks the array size, and then call realloc().  The call to 
	// realloc() will reallocate the block of memory, we pass it the memory 
	// address of the existing block of memory as well as the size in bytes needed
	// for the reallocated block of memory.  realloc() will return the pointer 
	// (memory address) for the reallocated block of memory.
	// 
	// If there is enough unused space in memory next to the existing block of 
	// memory then realloc() can just increase the size of this block of memory 
	// and return the same pointer (memory address) as before.  But if there 
	// isn't realloc() will find another place in memory and return a pointer 
	// for that new address in memory.  In this case, realloc() will also copy 
	// the existing data from the old location in memory to the new location 
	// in memory.
	//
	// In the below solution to keep things simple we just store the returned 
	// pointer back into data, so that before and after the call to realloc(),
	// even if the block is moved, data will point to the block of memory.  But
	// note that realloc() could fail and if it does it will return NULL (i.e. 
	// a pointer to nothing).  This would then cause a memory leak when we 
	// overwrite the original memory address stored in data with NULL, and we 
	// lose access to the original block of memory.  So really we should use 
	// a temporary pointer variable in this situation to safely handle realloc()
	// failure as covered here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skqCnhhA0ZY
	//
	length += 2;
	data = realloc(data, length * sizeof(int));

	// Set the additional two elements in the array to these values
	data[3] = 7;
	data[4] = 8;

	// Loop through and output the data in the array
	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
	{
		printf("data[%d] = %d\n", i, data[i]);
	}

	// Free the dynamically allocated memory.  We do this to avoid a memory leak
	// and so our program could potentially use this memory again.
	free(data);

	return 0;
